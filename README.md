# World-Oldest-Businesses-
This project use joining techniques to discover the oldest businesses in the world.

## Introduction

In this project, we analyze data using Python to gain insights and answer questions. We use Jupyter Notebook to write our code and present our findings.

## Data

The data used in this project is a CSV file containing Netflix data. We import the data into our notebook and clean it as needed.

## Analysis

We start by exploring the data and understanding its structure. We then use various Python libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib to analyze the data and visualize our findings. We perform various data analysis tasks such as:

- Data cleaning and preparation
- Data exploration
- Data visualization
- Data modeling and prediction

## Results

We present our findings in this section using various visualizations such as graphs, charts, and tables. We also provide insights and interpretations of the data and answer the questions we set out to explore in the introduction.

## Conclusion

Well, as we suspected, non-typical genres such as children's movies and documentaries are all clustered around the bottom half of the plot. But we can't know for certain until we perform additional analyses. We are not certain that movies are getting shorter.

## Dependencies

This project requires the following Python libraries:

- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib

To install these libraries, run the following command:

```
!pip install pandas numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage

To use this project, clone the repository and run the Jupyter Notebook file in your local environment. Make sure to have the required dependencies installed.

## Credits
